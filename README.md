# Housing_Price_Prediction
In this program, I have tried to predict the price of houses using the pre-built dataset of USA.
First all the required modules are imported.
then dataset named "USA_housing.csv" file is imported from which we will be training and testing our model.
The result of regression and our model training can be obtained by running 'Predict.ipynb' file.
